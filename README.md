# Eller-s-Algorithm-Maze-Generator

This little 3D game made in Unreal Engine 4 showcases my implementation of Eller's algorithm for incremental generation of perfect mazes. The maze is generated as the player walks.

Controls

Move using W/A/S/D
Look around using the mouse
Jump high using SPACE BAR
Shoot projectile using F

Objective

Your goal is to reach the house on the other side of the wall. To do so, head towards the maze. As you approach, a portion of the maze will be generated. To shoot projectiles, you must pick up ammo on the floor. You can break the walls of the maze by throwing three projectiles at them (this does not work for the outer walls). To short-circuit the maze and end the incremental generation, shoot a projectile in the empty space where the next row is supposed to be created. This will ensure that the maze is perfect (fully traversable, without cycles).
